The App I developed helps us remove the background of the selected images without an internet connection or any of the AI models working.
The only essential thing is the app must be iOS 17 or above. Otherwise, the app will need to remove the background by getting help from the AI models.

I have been inspired by the documentation below [**here**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/applying_visual_effects_to_foreground_subjects).


The Framework I have got help from is excellent. Besides removing the background the framework can detect rectangles and texts in images, Analyzing Image Similarity with Feature Print, and also remove the background of live videos.
